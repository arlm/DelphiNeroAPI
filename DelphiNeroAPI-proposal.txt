	Ahead Software has released an SDK (Software Development Kit) called Nero SDK, in order to give access to developers to Nero's Embedded API. Nero Burning ROM is one of the most popular CD/DVD burning softwares for Windows and this SDK gives access to teh API, enabling developers to to add their powerful CD/DVD-writing functions to one's own applications. For example, you can record on CD/DVD graphics files right from one's graphics application. This API also enables the developers to add new audio formats to Nero, Nero Express and NeroMIX.
	Ahead Software is distributing Nero API version 1.02 for C/C++ developers. The project translates the API headers and has a wrapper to access the API from Delphi and thus enable Delphi developers to burn CD/DVD directly from their own software.
	The project is compiled on Delphi 7, the platform it runs into is at least: Pentium 90 processor, 16 MB RAM, 12 MB free hard disk space, CD-R, or CD-RW, DVD-R/RW or DVD+RW drive and Windows 95, 98, ME, NT 4.0, 2000 or XP versions. In order to fullfill the objective the project needs Ahead Nero's libraries or Nero Burning ROM software installed on the machine.
